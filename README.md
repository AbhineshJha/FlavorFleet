Running Amplication
</summary> <br />

> **Note**
> It is also possible to start development with GitHub Codespaces, when navigating to `< > Code`, select `Codespaces` instead of `Local`. Click on either the `+`-sign or the `Create codespace on master`-button.

Amplication is using a monorepo architecture - powered by <a href="https://nx.dev">Nx Workspaces</a> - where multiple application and libraries exist in a single repository. To setup a local development environment the following steps can be followed:

###

1. Clone the repository and install dependencies:
```shell
git clone https://github.com/amplication/amplication.git && cd amplication && npm install
```

2. Run the setup script, which takes care of installing dependencies, building packages and setting up the workspace:
```shell
npm run setup:dev
```

3. Option 1: Running the required infrastructure - view infrastructure component logs


```shell
npm run docker:dev
```
3. Option 2: Running the required infrastructure - run the infrastructure components in background
```shell
npm run docker:dev -- -d
```

4. Apply database migrations
```shell
npm run db:migrate:deploy
```

5. To start developing, run one or more of the applications available under `serve:[application]` scripts of the package.json.

```shell
# running the server component
npm run serve:server

# running the client component
npm run serve:client

# running the data-service-generator component
npm run serve:dsg

# running the git-pull-request-service component
npm run serve:git

# running the plugin-api component
npm run serve:plugins
```

> **Note**
> In order to run the Amplication client properly, both the client and server need to be started by the `npm run serve:[application]` command, aswell as additional component for development on a specific component.

The development environment should now be set up. Additional information on the different application component can be found under packages/`[application]`/README.md file. Happy hacking! üëæ
